# ![mod icon representing a pixelated 8x8 villager head](src/main/resources/assets/letvillagersbe/icon.png) Let Villagers Be [Fabric]

## Features
- players can't right-click villagers out of their beds
- players can't left-click damage sleeping villagers
- *(not implemented yet)* players can't hurt villagers with projectiles (like snowballs)
- villagers can't be moved/pushed while sleeping
- players can't break the bed a villager is sleeping in
- *(experimental)* pistons can't destroy beds with a sleeping villager in it

## Known Issues
- needs to be installed on both **client** and **server-side**
- translations only work when installing the mod both on the client and server
  - if installed server-side only, translations won't work
  - will possibly add an option to disable text altogether in the future so the mod can installed server-side only
  - maybe look into [Server Translations API](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/Server-Translations) to make translations for server-side only installations work
